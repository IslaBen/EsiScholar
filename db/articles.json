Semantically rich language such as Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) has been created in order to provide a mechanism for describing the semantics of semantic web services. Unfortunately, for the common developer the learning curve for such languages can be steep, providing a barrier for adoption and widespread use. In this paper, we present a ModelDriven Architecture (MDA) approach for facilitating the specification of WSMO ontology through the use of meta-model and UML profile for modelling semantic web services; we concentrate our efforts to develop a transformation approach based on MDA to automate the generation of code by translating XMI specifications (e.g. XML encodings of UML) into equivalent WSMO specifications using Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) transformations.",

Design/methodology/approach This paper is divided into two parts. The first one is to improve the result of the prediction. In this part, two ideas are proposed: the double pruning enhanced random forest algorithm and extracting a shared learning base from the stratified random sampling method to obtain a representative learning base of all original data. The second part proposes to design a distributed architecture supported by new technologies solutions, which in turn works in a coherent and efficient way with the sampling strategy under the supervision of the Map-Reduce algorithm. Findings The representative learning base obtained by the integration of two learning bases, the partial base and the shared base, presents an excellent representation of the original data set and gives very good results of the Big Data predictive analytics. Furthermore, these results were supported by the improved random forests supervised learning method, which played a key role in this context. Originality/value All companies are concerned, especially those with large amounts of information and want to screen them to improve their knowledge for the customer and optimize their campaigns.",

The pragmatic web represents the most recent extension of the web (semantic web); which facilitates the exploitation and the interpretation of the data by the machine. This web is based on three important components, the context, the community, and the meaning negotiation. The Meaning negotiation is the most important component of the pragmatic web on which we will fix our attention. It plays an important role in the exchanges and resolves conflicts in people cooperation activities. The knowledge (context) of each part in the community of users is heterogeneous; this will make the meaning negotiation complicated. This paper realizes a meaning negotiation scenario based on the ontologies merging into the geopolitical domain. This will reduce and simplifies the process, and improves the semantics of data.",

As many images are compressed by transforms, constructing the feature vector directly in transform domain is a very popular topic. Therefore features can be extracted directly from images in compressed format by using, for example, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for JPEG compressed images.

		"abstract": "La recherche d’images par le contenu (CBIR) est le processus qui permet la recherche des images numériques dans une large base de données. Comme la majorité des images sont stockées dans un format compressé, les caractéristiques peuvent être extraites directement à partir de la Transformée Cosinus Discrète (DCT) des images JPEG compressées. Dans la recherche d’images par le contenu qui utilise les blocs DCT, les blocs sont définis indépendamment du contenu de l’image. Les blocs contours contiennent des pixels de l’objet et d’autres de l’arrière-plan ou bien d’un autre objet qui se trouve à côté. Ainsi, l’indexation et la recherche indépendante des objets par cette méthode est impossible. Toutefois, la qualité de la recherche est très mauvaise. Aussi l’application de la DCT standard aux blocs frontières des objets entraîne une oscillation spectrale très importante. Pour contourner ce problème, on propose un système d’indexation et de la recherche d’images basée région (RBIR) qui prend en considération une segmentation à priori de l’image en régions, tel qu’il a était définit dans MPEG-4 et utilise la SA-DCT pour l’extraction des caractéristiques des blocs frontières. Donc une image est représentée par des régions segmentées, et chaque région est associée à un vecteur de caractéristiques dérivé à partir de la DCT pour les blocs intérieurs et la SA-DCT pour les segments des blocs frontières. Chaque région de l’image requête, peut être sélectionnée comme objet principal pour faire la recherche. Pour les images qui n’ont pas un objet principal, l’utilisateur peut sélectionner l’image entière comme requête. L’objectif du travail proposé est la confirmation de l’efficacité du système proposé par des résultats expérimentaux et des comparaisons par rapport aux systèmes déjà existants. Les résultats montrent l’efficacité et la justesse du système proposé et il est comparable avec des systèmes connus dans le domaine RBIR.",

		"abstract": "Depuis de nombreuses années, l'image numérique est un outil favorisé dans des domaines très divers telles que la médecine, l'imagerie satellitaire et la télévision numérique. Dans ces domaines, lorsqu'on parle d'images et de séquences vidéo, ces sources d'informations brutes représentent une quantité de données très importantes et contiennent beaucoup de textures redondantes. D'où la nécessiter de mise en place des méthodes d'encodage et de compression, avant la transmission ou le stockage, qui permettent de représenter la même information mais avec beaucoup moins de données. En plus, puis ce que les images prennent une part de plus en plus volumineuse, il apparaît important de concevoir des systèmes d'indexations, capables de mener à terme la recherche d'informations au sein de très grandes collections d'images numériques.\r\nDans cette thèse, deux nouveaux systèmes basés-régions et basés sur les transformations DCT et SA-DCT, qui sont largement utilisées dans le domaine de la compression, sont proposés.\r\nLe premier système est un système de codage de la vidéo qui permet de coder les objets dans les images de la séquence de façon indépendante et d'offrir plus de flexibilité sur le contrôle de la largeur de bande pour la transmission. Ce codec permet de mieux coder les frontières de différentes régions.\r\nTandis que le deuxième système est un système d'indexation et de la recherche d'images basée région (RBIR) qui prend en considération une segmentation a priori de l'image en région, tel qu'il a été défini dans MPEG-4. Autrement dit, une image est représentée par des régions segmentées, et chaque région est associée à un vecteur de caractéristiques dérivé à partir de la DCT et la SA-DCT.

Un système conjoint peut être réalisé à partir des deux systèmes proposés puisqu'il s'agit de deux systèmes qui ont le même objectif (basé-région) et qui travaillent avec les mêmes transformations DCT et SA-DCT.",

Dans un premier temps, nous traitons le cas de la régression relative réelle et comme résultat asymptotique, on s'intéresse à la démonstration de la convergence presque complète de l'estimateur. Dans la deuxième partie de ce travail, nous supposons que l'échantillon étudié  est constitué de variables quasi-associées; sous des conditions de régularité qui caractérisent l'espace de notre modèle non-paramétrique, nous démontrons la convergence presque complète uniforme ainsi que la normalité asymptotique de notre estimateur. Ensuite, nous considérons le cas où la variable explicative est de type fonctionnel. Nous supposons que l'échantillon est composé de variables fortement-mélangeantes et nous établissons la convergence presque complète de l'estimateur étudié.

		"abstract": "The rapid development of remote sensing technology allows us to get images with high and very high resolution (VHR). VHR imagery scene classification has become an important and challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce a framework for VHR scene understanding. First, the pretrained visual geometry group network (VGG-Net) model is proposed as deep feature extractors to extract informative features from the original VHR images. Second, we select the fully connected layers constructed by VGG-Net in which each layer is regarded as separated feature descriptors. And then we combine between them to construct final representation of the VHR image scenes. Third, discriminant correlation analysis (DCA) is adopted as feature fusion strategy to further refine the original features extracting from VGG-Net, which allows a more efficient fusion approach with small cost than the traditional feature fusion strategies. We apply our approach to three challenging data sets: 1) UC MERCED data set that contains 21 different areal scene categories with submeter resolution; 2) WHU-RS data set that contains 19 challenging scene categories with various resolutions; and 3) the Aerial Image data set that has a number of 10 000 images within 30 challenging scene categories with various resolutions. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Using feature fusion technique achieves a higher accuracy than solely using the raw deep features. Moreover, the proposed method based on DCA fusion produces good informative features to describe the images scene with much lower dimension.",

		"title": "Modélisation sémantique du cloud computing : vers une composition de services DaaS à sémantique incertaine",
		"genre": "Thesis",
		"source": "rdoc.univ-sba.dz",
		"abstract": "Avec l'émergence du mouvement Open Data, des centaines de milliers de sources de données provenant de divers domaines (e.g., santé, gouvernementale, statistique, etc.) sont maintenant disponibles sur Internet. Ces sources de données sont accessibles et interrogées via des  services cloud DaaS, et cela afin de bénéficier de la flexibilité, l'interopérabilité et la scalabilité que les paradigmes SOA et Cloud Computing  peuvent apporter à l'intégration des données. Dans ce contexte, les requêtes sont résolues par la composition de plusieurs services DaaS. Définir la sémantique des services cloud DaaS est la première étape vers l'automatisation de leur composition. Une approche intéressante pour définir la sémantique des services DaaS est de les décrire comme étant des vues sémantiques à travers une ontologie de domaine.   Cependant, la définition de ces vues sémantiques ne peut pas être toujours faite avec certitude, surtout lorsque les données retournées par un service sont trop complexes. Dans cette thèse, nous proposons une approche probabiliste pour représenter les services DaaS à sémantique incertaine.  Dans notre approche, un service DaaS dont la sémantique est  incertaine est décrit par plusieurs vues sémantiques possibles, chacune avec une probabilité.  Les services ainsi que leurs vues sémantiques possibles sont représentées dans un registre de services probabiliste (PSR).  Selon les dépendances qui existent entre les services, les corrélations dans PSR peuvent être représentées par deux modèles différents: le modèle Bloc-indépendant-disjoint (BID), et le modèle à base des réseaux bayésiens. En se basant sur nos modèles probabilistes, nous étudions le problème de l'interprétation d'une composition existante impliquant des services à sémantique incertaine. Nous étudions aussi le problème de la réécriture de requêtes à travers les services DaaS incertains, et nous proposons des algorithmes efficaces permettant de calculer les différentes compositions possibles ainsi que leurs probabilités. Nous menons une série d’expérimentation pour évaluer la performance de nos différents algorithmes de composition. Les résultats obtenus montrent l’efficacité et la scalabilité de nos solutions proposées.",

		"abstract": "Mobile users lose a lot of time on their smartphones. They interact even with busy hands (hands-free interactions), distracted eyes (eyes-free interactions) and in different life situations (while walking, eating, working, etc.). The Time Well Spent (TWS) is a movement that aims to design applications which respect the users choices and availability. In this paper, we discuss how the multimodal mobile interactions and the TWS movement can support each other to protect the users time. We start by giving an overview of mobile multimodal interaction and highlighting the TWS concept. Then, we present our vision about applying mobile multimodality as a means to protect the users time. We show that multimodality can support the TWS by encouraging self-restraint, while the TWS supports multimodality by making the interaction modalities meaningful. Finally, we discuss our future works in this context.",

However, mobile applications end-users are often faced with interaction restrictions and do not yet have the possibility to modify their interaction modalities, according to their needs. In this paper, we present an approach that allows smartphone users to add and modify the interaction modalities of their already installed mobile applications, according to their preferences and needs.

This region is characterized by high ambient temperature in the summer, strong solar insolation potential and low humidity rate. The data measurement was carried out in the Unit of Research in Renewable energy URERMS in various daily climatic condition (clear, cloudy and Sandstorm day). The performance evaluation based on the monitoring of PV array and inverter performance during the system operation derived parameters included final yield, reference yield, performance ratio and system efficiency. The analysis shows that the lowest value was in the performance ratio and efficiency of the PV module, system and the inverter, and the maximum value was in the capture and system losses, since the values in clear day were 76.5%, 10.88%, 94.65%, 10.29%, 1.18h/day and 0.26h/day respectively due to high average ambient temperature 32.3 °C. The lowest value was in reference yield, array yield, final yield in sandstorm day were 2.65kWh/kWp/day, 2.17kW h/kWp/day and 2.12kW h/kWp/day respectively due to low level of solar irradiation was 2.65kW h/m2, which caused by high wind speed 6.9m/s with sand dust particles. The experimental results show that the lowest values of the system efficiency and performance ratio (10.29% and 76.5% respectively) caused by the high module temperature equal to 41.1 °C in the clear day, and the fast-changing of the solar irradiance is caused by variation of clouds cover or dust storm affects the energy generated and stability of the PV system.",

The visual inspection of 62 PV modules has allowed to observe and determine the degradation modes such as, EVA discoloration, delamination, busbar corrosion, cracking of solar cell, glass breakage, AR coating and solder bond. The degradation evaluation of three modules with different defects was also performed, using (I-V/P-V) characteristics and the degradation rates of the parameters (Pmax, Imp, Vmp, Isc, Voc, FF) at Standard test conditions (STC) in order to compare with the nominal data delivered by the manufacturer of photovoltaic panels. Finally, the combination of the partial shading effect and the presence of EVA browning defect was examined to assess the changes in I-V and P-V curves caused by the drop in electrical parameters.",

The achievement of this analysis has been done by performing an accurate evaluation of the different impacts of the environment parameters on the operating performance of the grid-tied PV system. The data set covers 12 operating months and has been collected by our team from the Research Unit on Renewable Energy (URER-MS). The collected experimental data reveal that the environmental parameters variation has direct effect on the performance of both energy conversion efficiency and system losses. The grid was supplied with a power of 4322.65 kWh during the year 2015, where the annual average temperature was 28.30 °C. An important variation in performance parameters have been observed for different months. The yield values of max/min monthly average daily reference, array and final were; 7.68/5.7 kW h/kWp/day, 6.07/4.24 kW h/kWp/day and 5.75/3.98 kW h/kWp/day, respectively. The PV module, inverter and overall system efficiency reached; 14.19/11.10%, 95.34/93.94% and 13.53/10.50%, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the performance ratio (PR) varies from 66.66% to 85.93% and the annual average capacity factor was 7.91%.",

The objective of this study is to investigate the reduction in the electrical performance caused by sandstorm and the accumulation of sand dust on the photovoltaic module surface installed in the Saharan area of south Algeria (Adrar). For this purpose, four PV modules (ISO-100/24) were selected and their current–voltage characteristics were measured to evaluate the sand dust effect on their performances. Our results show that sandstorm and dust accumulation on the surface of the module reduce the performance in terms of energy and power, due to a decrease of the transmittance. Obtained outcomes show that in sandstorm periods, the particle deposition density is much higher. This study reveals that leaving PV module without any cleaning in the Saharan environmental conditions significantly reduces PV power output, in addition to the presence of the shading mismatch effects in case of partial cleaning.",

		"abstract": "The Algerian economy is strongly dependent on fossil fuels’ market where 93.6% of its exportations are mainly oil and natural gas. During the last decade, the market price of crude oil has fallen down drastically and up to this date its price is still fluctuating which have severely affected the national economy. Consequently, the transition to renewable energy exploitation and technology development became an indispensable objective for the Algerian government. Algeria is planning to shift to the era of green economy which is the unique solution to meet future energy needs and reduce environment-related risks simultaneously. The Algerian territory is characterized by abundant renewable energy resources such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and geothermal energy. In this paper, a brief energy profile and renewable energy potential have been reviewed. The present study shows that the installed capacity concerning both photovoltaic and wind power plant; which have reached 354.3 MW (at June 2018), compared to the declared government targets presents slow integration progress of renewable energy compared to the large available renewable energy potential especially solar energy. Despite the considerable efforts made by the Algerian State to face of the challenges of reducing the economic dependency upon hydrocarbon revenues and greenhouse gas emissions (135.5 MT of carbon dioxide emission in 2018). This work provides useful information about the status of renewable energies in Algeria, which is considered as a scientific platform for researchers and industrial companies to seek suitable solutions for promoting the renewable energy field.",

		"abstract": "Les méthodes de classification automatiques sont un outil important de nos jours pour identifier différentes données et étudier leurs propriétés. On retrouve aujourd'hui l'utilisation des réseaux de neurones en tant que classifieurs dans plusieurs domaines d'application, notamment, le dépistage du cancer du sein. En effet, dans cet axe de recherche, beaucoup de travaux ont été réalisés en employant une approche neuronale pour la reconnaissance de formes et ont abouti à des résultats intéressants. Ceci étant, chaque modèle de réseau de neurones diffère d'un autre de par ses paramètres expérimentaux, sa complexité d'implantation et son domaine d'applicabilité. Ainsi, chaque modèle possède ses avantages et ses inconvénients, faisant qu'il soit plus approprié pour une tâche donnée qu'un autre. Dans (Freeman 1987, Freeman et al., 1988) des expérimentations electrophysiologiques ont été réalisées sur des lapins prouvant l'existence de la dynamique chaotique dans les neurones réels. Depuis les années quatre-vingts, les réseaux de neurones chaotiques ont été le centre d'intérêt de plusieurs travaux en raison de leur dynamique complexe et leur application potentielle dans la dynamique associative, l'optimisation, et le traitement de l'information (Adachi et Aihara, 1997 ; Aihara et al., 1990 ; Tokuda et al., 1997). Dans cette optique, on s'intéresse dans ce travail à étudier la performance d'un modèle de réseau de neurones chaotique sur une tâche de classification reliée à la détection du cancer du sein. À cet effet, on procède dans un premier temps à la revue critique de certains travaux portant sur le sujet et qui ont été rapportés dans la littérature, de manière à situer le travail par rapport à ces travaux et mettre en évidence les contributions qu'il permet. Une étude comparative est ensuite établie où l'on met en avant les avantages d'utiliser une mémoire associative bidirectionnelle chaotique pour le travail de classification, relativement à deux modèles de réseau de neurones classiques, à savoir, une mémoire associative bidirectionnelle standard et un réseau multicouche à rétropropagation d'erreur.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays, the diversity and large deployment of video recorders result in a large volume of video data, whose effective use requires a video indexing process. However, this process generates a major problem consisting in the semantic gap between the extracted low-level features and the ground truth. The ontology paradigm provides a promising solution to overcome this problem. However, no naming syntax convention has been followed in the concept creation step, which constitutes another problem. In this paper, we have considered these two issues and have developed a full video surveillance ontology following a formal naming syntax convention and semantics that addresses queries of both academic research and industrial applications. In addition, we propose an ontology video surveillance indexing and retrieval system (OVIS) using a set of semantic web rule language (SWRL) rules that bridges the semantic gap problem. Currently, the existing indexing systems are essentially based on low-level features and the ontology paradigm is used only to support this process with representing surveillance domain. In this paper, we developed the OVIS system based on the SWRL rules and the experiments prove that our approach leads to promising results on the top video evaluation benchmarks and also shows new directions for future developments.",

Regarding manual annotation as seriously time-consuming and automatic ones as large-scale of video unsatisfied, our topic of interest belongs to the semi-automatic annotation, where a little set of video is annotated manually and this will be propagated to the entire databases. We try to consider annotation able to exploit unconsidered concepts to help for improving annotation and XML performance. Our approach takes the low level descriptors' MPEG7 file added to the ontology's lexicon as input, and defines concepts of high level as output. Hence, an annotated video database is created.",

This decision is called the network selection. In this paper, we propose a modified-SAW function to deal with the drawbacks of the existing solutions. Indeed, the existing MADMs methods suffer mainly from the famous problem of rank reversal once an alternative is added or removed, other problems occur in the legacy MADMs such as the sensitiveness to the user preference in TOPSIS; the penalization of the alternatives with poor attributes values in WPM. Our simulations brought out the lakes of the traditional MADMs approach in the context of network selection. We modify the SAW method intelligently and we use it to solve the network selection problem. Finally, we compare the performance of our solution with the previous works in different scenarios; the simulations show that our proposal outperforms the other existing methods.",

The paper presents the network selection problem, after that, introduces the game theory models, and finally solving the network selection problem using the game theory framework.",

Its main functionalities include Admission Control AC and Packet Scheduling PS. This paper will center mainly on the PS part of the RRM task, which performs the radio resource allocation in both uplink and downlink directions. Several approaches and algorithms have been proposed in the literature to address this need ie : allocate resources efficiently, the diversity and multitude of algorithms is related to the factors considered for the optimal management of radio resource, specifically, the traffic type and the QoS Quality of Service requested by the UE. In this article, an art's state of the radio resource allocation strategies and a detailed study of several scheduling algorithms proposed for LTE (uplink and downlink) are made. Therefore, we offer our evaluation and criticism.",

The input is a faulty program for which a counter-example and a postcondition are provided. To identify helpful information for error location, we generate a constraint system for the paths of the control flow graph for which at most k conditional statements may be erroneous. Then, we calculate Minimal Correction Sets (MCS) of bounded size for each of these paths. The removal of one of these sets of constraints yields a maximal satisfiable subset, in other words, a maximal subset of constraints satisfying the post condition. To compute the MCS, we extend the algorithm proposed by Liffiton and Sakallah [21] in order to handle programs with numerical statements more efficiently. The main advantage of this flow-driven approach is that the computed sets of suspicious instructions are small, each of them being associated with an identified path. Moreover, the constraint-programming based framework of LocFaults allows mixing Boolean and numerical constraints in an efficient and straightforward way. Preliminary experiments are quite encouraging.",

It does involve (i) to construct feasible business process designs with optimum attributes, and (ii) to classify the obtained solutions using a simple and scientific approach understandable by the decision maker.

The work presented in this paper is aimed to investigate the benefits that come from the utilization of multiple-criteria decision analysis methods (MCDA) with an evolutionary multi objective optimization algorithms (EMOA) execution process.

		"abstract": "In this article, a research was conducted on the importance of the initialization of population on the solutions resulting from an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMOO). This means how the technique applied in the population's initialization can affect -supposed- optimized solutions after a certain number of iterations in a multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Knowing that Pareto front is the ideal to reach, the presented work propose to utilize a Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis method (MCDA) to sort or classify the initial population. To achieve this goal, an EMOO Framework is implemented which uses (i) conflicting optimization criteria, (ii) NSGAII as an EA and (iii) MR-sort method is used as a MCDA for classification. The experiments results clearly indicate that the proposed Framework is capable of producing an acceptable number of optimized design alternatives regarding the problem complexity and in a reasonable period.",

These descriptors can be used for classification, such as in face recognition. Zernike moments and Legendre moments have already been used for this purpose. This paper proposes to use moment-based Angular Radial Transform for extracting the face characteristics that feed a Support Vector Machine or a Nearest Neighbor Classifier for face recognition. Facial images from the ORL database, Essex Faces94 database, Essex Faces96 database, and Yale database were used for testing the proposed approach. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed method is more efficient, in terms of recognition rate, than the methods based on Zernike and Legendre moments. It is also found that its performance is comparable to that of the best state-of-the-arts methods.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays face recognition systems are facing a new problem after having won the challenge of reliability. The problem is that these systems have become vulnerable to attacks by identity theft. In order to deceive the recognition systems hackers use several methods, such as the use of face images or videos of people belonging to the system database. Luckily, this type of attack is thwarted by the use of adapted systems. But unfortunately another type of attack that uses 3D face masks appeared. This type of attack is very efficient, since as will be shown, a high percentage of hackers who use 3D masks can mislead a good facial recognition system, like the one used in our investigation. In this paper, a new method is proposed for the detection of hackers that use 3D masks to deceive face recognition systems. This method uses the Angular Radial Transformation (ART) to extract pertinent features that are fed into a classifier to decide whether the captured image represents a face image. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using a public 3D Mask Attack Database (3DMAD). The obtained results show the efficiency of the proposed method, since it can reduce the error rate in discriminating between a real face and a face mask down to 0.90%.",

		"abstract": "Due to their advantages, facial recognition systems are among the most widely used biometric systems in recent years. However, their drawback is that they can easily be deceived by using 3D masks, which are replicas of real faces. To confirm this fact, we have tested the vulnerability to 3D masks attacks of the already approved Legendre moments invariants (LMI)-based face recognition method. This has been achieved by using the 3D mask attack database (3DMAD), which consists of real faces and faces with 3D masks. The obtained spoof false acceptance rate (SFAR) was close to 65%, which proves that this recognition system is vulnerable to 3D masks attacks. This is generally the case of other face recognition systems, with no anti-spoofing provision. In this paper, a face recognition method is proposed to prevent hackers from deceiving face recognition systems by using 3D masks of people belonging to the system database. This method combines the LMI and the linear discriminant analysis for characteristic features extraction, and the maximum likelihood for classification. With a 97.6% recognition rate and a SFAR equal to 0.83%, the results obtained may be considered as very satisfactory. These results, while obtained with a lower computational time, compare favorably with those of the state-of-the-art method that uses the same 3DMAD database.",

		"page": "639-653",
		"volume": "86",
		"issue": "1",
		"abstract": "This paper presents a new symmetric scheme for enciphering digital images. The proposal is based on the combination of chaos and cellular automata (CA) under the scenarios of one round enciphering/deciphering and permutation–diffusion architecture. All the generated key-streams in the proposed cryptosystem are based on the use of an improved one-dimensional (1D) chaotic system [i.e., logistic–tent system (LTS)] with excellent chaotic properties. These key-streams are related to both the secret key and the characteristics of the plain image. Before applying the encryption process, one pixel of the plain image at a random position is overwritten by inserting the weighted histogram value as a new measure to represent the plain image’s features, this pixel withholds the encryption routine and further will be used to guarantee the resistance to known/chosen plain image attacks (CPA secure). In the confusion phase, a bit-level permutation is adopted with the generated one-time key-streams using an improved 1D chaotic system. This strategy of shuffling is handled in which besides to the modification of each pixel’s position, its value is also changed, to further render the achievement of both confusion and diffusion possible within just this phase. The diffusion phase is divided into two subphases: In the first one, the value of each pixel is changed sequentially by means of an improved one-dimensional chaotic system, to fasten the diffusion process and spread the influence of a single bit over the others, and in the second subphase, two-dimensional reversible memory cellular automata are associated with quadtree decomposition strategy and applied to the output of the first subphase, to enhance both the security and the diffusion effect of the cryptosystem. Security analysis shows the capacity of the proposed scheme to resist the commonly known attacks besides to its competitive speed that traces its suitability for practical image encryption.",

With respect to exiting schemes, the proposed one permits to reach high sensitivity degrees without the need for multiple confusion/diffusion rounds.

		"volume": "60",
		"abstract": "This paper proposes a new chaotic cipher algorithm for efficient and secure image content preservation, this method is specialized for both standard and medical images, and it consists of two modules which are iteratively performed: chaotic confusion and pixel diffusion. An improved 1D chaotic system (i.e., Logistic Tent System (LTS)) is employed in both confusion and diffusion modules, where its initial conditions are dynamically generated and controlled by the external secret key and SHA-256 hash value of the plain image, conducted to random-like generating key-streams, elevated the sensitivity to small changes on the plain image, and hence ensured the immunity of the proposal against known/chosen plain image attacks. The confusion module is governed by a novel nonlinear bit-shuffling and circular-shifting technique, aiming to achieve bit balancing effect, mixing effect of the pixel value, and certain diffusion mechanism. The diffusion module is ruled by means of an improved XOR operation (eXOR), to further promote the sensitivity to plain image, and accelerate the diffusion mechanism of the overall cipher algorithm. Given that the diffusion mechanism with respect to pixel value mixing are contributed by the two modules, only one encryption round is needed to make a good combination between computational performance, and sufficient security. The obtained results indicate the high performance in terms of execution-time and security level of the proposed cipher algorithm, and validate its robustness against cryptographic attacks, and hence confirm its efficiency for real-time secure image transmission.",

Nevertheless, tracking personal signs to enable such applications has given rise to serious privacy issues, especially when using external activity recognition services. In this paper, we propose (Π-Knn): a privacy-preserving version of the K Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier that is mainly built on (Π-CSP+): a novel cryptography-free private similarity evaluation protocol. As a sample application, we consider a medical monitoring system enhanced with a HAR process based on our privacy preserving classifier. The integration of the privacy preserving HAR aims to improve the accuracy of the clinical decision support. We conduct a standard security analysis to prove that our protocols provide a complete privacy protection against malicious adversaries. We perform a comparative performance evaluation through several experiments while using real HAR system parameters. Experimental evaluations show that our protocol (Π-CSP+) incurs a low increasing overhead (37% in Online classification and 50% in Offline classification) compared to PCSC, a representative state-of-the art protocol, which incurs 3600% and 4800% in online and offline classification respectively. Besides, Π-CSP+ provides a stable and efficient response time (W=0.0x ms) for both short and long duration activities while serving up to 1000 clients.

		"abstract": "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology for automatic object identification that has been implemented in several real-life applications. In this work, we expand a novel relevant application of RFID tags for grocery stores, which aims to check the adequacy of food items with respect to the shoppers' personal preferences. Unlike similar works, we focus on shoppers' privacy and running time efficiency. For this aim, we propose a novel private set intersection (PSI) protocol to be used in matching the shoppers' personal preferences with the set of each item's adequate profiles that are held by the back-end server of the store. We provide a standard security proof against curious stores and malicious customers. For efficiency concern, we build our protocol without cryptographic operations, and we achieve a linear asymptotic complexity of O (v + c) for communications and store-side computations, where v and c are the numbers of profiles in the store's back-end server and the shopper's list of preferences respectively. Moreover, experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the art solutions reveal the scalability of our novel PSI protocol for big market stores.",

		"abstract": "Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a fundamental multi-party computation primitive used to secure many political, commercial, and social applications. PSI allows mistrustful parties to compute the intersection of their private sets without leaking additional information. PSI protocols have been largely proposed for both the semi-honest and the malicious settings. Nevertheless, the semi-honest setting does not suffice in many realistic scenarios and security in the malicious setting is built upon cryptographic schemes, which require hard assumptions and induce a high computational cost. In this work, we propose a novel two-party PSI protocol secure under the mixed model, where the server may be semi-honest and the client may be malicious. We build our protocol upon matrix algebra without using any cryptographic schemes or non-standard assumptions and we provide simulation-based security proof. Our protocol achieves a linear asymptotic complexity of O(kv+kc)O(kv+kc)O(k_v+k_c) for communications and server computations, where kvkvk_v and kckck_c are sizes of the server and the client sets. Besides, we compare empirical performance of our solution to the insecure hashing solution used in practice. Experimental results reveal the efficiency and the scalability of our new PSI protocol, which makes it adequate for Big Data analytics.",

Ce système utilise la structure du réseau vasculaire rétinien comme trait biométrique quasi-impossible de falsifier. En outre, la configuration macroscopique de la vascularisation rétinienne d’une personne demeure stable durant toute sa vie et son modèle de branchement est unique pour chaque individu.\r\nDans ce travail, nous proposons un algorithme de vérification automatique de l’identité basé sur la structure du réseau vasculaire de la rétine humaine. Plus précisément, le modèle biométrique est constitué des coordonnées géométriques des points de bifurcation et des croisements des branches du réseau vasculaire. L’objectif principal de notre travail est de réaliser un système efficace tout en minimisant le temps de traitement et la taille des données traitées. Par conséquent, cet algorithme utilise une nouvelle combinaison de techniques puissantes pour l’extraction de caractéristiques basées sur la morphologie mathématique, comme la ligne de partage des eaux pour la segmentation du système vasculaire rétinien et la transformation Hit-or-Miss pour la détection des points de bifurcation et des croisements.\r\nDe l’acquisition et l’amélioration des images rétiniennes à la comparaison des signatures passant par le recalage automatique, chaque étape de l’algorithme est optimisée afin d’améliorer les performances du système. Nous testons notre algorithme sur deux bases de d’images rétiniennes (ARIA et DRIVE). Enfin, nous présentons et discutons les résultats d’évaluation de notre algorithme, et le comparons avec ceux de la littérature.",

		"abstract": "Recently wireless sensor localization (WSN) has become very active research domain due to its large application where processes have to be spread over a large area. One of the several technical aspects of WSNs is the node localization, the main task of nodes localization is to find out the coordinates of the nodes in a short time with a minimum of energy. The recent trend is based on metaheuristic to result this problem where Node localization is treated as an optimization problem and many approaches are proposed. Once of recent algorithms is Bat Algorithm who is based on sending pulses and locating prey via receiving echolocation. The features of Bat have made the algorithm popular and give more efficiency in literature, the most research of node localization is addressed to treat only localization error. In this paper, the multi-criteria problem is treated and evaluated (localization (error/ time)) of the original Bat algorithm, the obtained result is presented as a comparative study among Bat algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and differential evolution.",

		"source": "www.informatica.si",
		"abstract": "Data in real world applications are in most cases linguistic information that are ambiguous and uncertain. Hence, such data should be handled by fuzzy set representation schemes to increase expressiveness and comprehensiveness. Moreover, mining these data requires ways to generate automatically useful information/knowledge through a set of fuzzy rules. This paper proposes a novel system called FuAGGE that stands for Fuzzy Automatic Generator Genetic Expression. The FuAGGE approach uses a grammar based   evolutionary technique. The grammar is expressed in the Backus Naur Form (BNF) and represents a fuzzy set covering method. The grammar is mapped into programs that are themselves implementations of fuzzy rule-based learners. Binary strings are used as inputs to the mapper along with the BNF grammar. These binary strings represent possible potential solutions resulting from the initializer component and the building blocks from Weka, a workbench that contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling. This operation facilitates the induction process and makes induced programs shorter. FuAGGE has been tested on a benchmark of well-known datasets and experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method. It is shown through comparison that our method outperforms most recent and similar, manual techniques. The system is able to generate rule-based learners specialized to specific domains, for example medical or biological data. The generated learners will be able to produces efficient rule models. The produced rule models will achieves more accurate classification for the specific used domain.",

		"abstract": "One of the main and fundamental tasks of data mining is the automatic induction of classification rules from a set of examples and observations. A variety of methods performing this task have been proposed in the recent literature. Many comparative studies have been carried out in this field. However, the main common feature between thesemethods is that they are designedmanually. In the meanwhile, there have been some successful attempts to automatically design such methods using Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP). In this paper, we propose a different system called Automatic Grammar Genetic Programming (AGGP) that can evolve complete java program codes. These codes represent a rule induction algorithm that uses a grammar evolution technique that governs a Backus Naur Form grammar definition mapping to a program. To perform this task, we will use binary strings as inputs to the mapper along with the Backus Naur Form grammar. Such binary strings represent possible potential solutions resulting from the initialized component and Weka building blocks, this would ease the induction process and makes induced programs short. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method. It is also shown that, compared to some recent and similar manual techniques (Prism, Ripper, Ridor, OneRule) the proposed method outperforms such techniques.Abenchmark of well-known data sets is used for the sake of comparison.",

		"abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are provided with a limited source of power. The lifetime of such networks is an overwhelming matter in most network applications. This lifetime depends strongly on how efficiently such energy is distributed over the nodes especially during transmitting and receiving data. Each node may route messages to destination nodes either through short hops or long hops. Optimizing the length of these hops may save energy, and therefore extend the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose a theorem to optimize the hop’s length so to make WSN power consumption minimal. The theorem establishes a simple condition on hop’s length range. Computer simulation when performing such condition on Mica2 sensors and Mica2dot sensors reveals good performance regarding WSNs energy consumption.",

		"abstract": "Service discovery is the process of retrieving the service most similar to the query based on the description of functional and/or non-functional semantics. The original algorithm used in literature was proposed by Paolucci et al., 2002. Some research works, propose an extension or an improvement of this algorithm to correct the matchmaking used. In this paper we present an algorithm of matchmaking that resolves the problems of Paolucci algorithm by using the shortest path algorithm which determines the optimal matching between user query and provider service. This approach is validated within a framework proposed at the end of this paper and compared with the greedy approach and the bipartite graph based matching.",

		"abstract": "The effectiveness and reliability of IS-based web services becomes a critical factor in business success. Known classical problems in the field of web services are imposed implicitly in the design and implementation of such systems, namely: description process of web service, publication process, discovery process, composition process, selection process, substitution, and adaptation process. The approach proposed in this paper allows the realisation of discovery and adaptation tasks based on the behavioural aspect of semantic web services. In this paper, we propose a new behaviour model for semantic web services using automata. The formal model used to specify the process of semantic web services is typed interface and weighted automaton (TIWA) with an operational semantics associated with different action necessary in the implementation of all the algorithms proposed in this paper.",

		"abstract": "With the emergence of the open data movement, hundreds of thousands of datasets from various concerns are now freely available on the Internet. The access to a good number of these datasets is carried out through Web services which provide a standard way to interact with data. In this context, user's queries often require the composition of multiple data Web services to be answered. Defining the semantics of data services is the first step towards automating their composition. An interesting approach to define the semantics of data services is by describing them as semantic views over a domain ontology. However, defining such semantic views cannot always be done with certainty, especially when the service's outputs are too complex. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach to model the semantics uncertainty of data services. In our approach, a data service with an uncertain semantics is described by several possible semantic views, each one is associated with a probability. Services along with their possible semantic views are represented in a Block-Independent-Disjoint (noted BID) probabilistic service registry, and interpreted based on the Possible Worlds Semantics. Based on our modeling, we study the problem of interpreting an existing composition involving services with uncertain semantics. We also study the problem of compositing uncertain data services to answer a user query, and propose an efficient method to compute the different possible compositions and their probabilities.",

		"abstract": "The semantic web goal is to share and integrate data across different domains and organizations. The knowledge representations of semantic data are made possible by ontology. As the usage of semantic web increases, construction of the semantic web ontologies is also increased. Moreover, due to the monolithic nature of the ontology various semantic web operations like query answering, data sharing, data matching, data reuse and data integration become more complicated as the size of ontology increases. Partitioning the ontology is the key solution to handle this scalability issue. In this work, we propose a revision and an enhancement of K-means clustering algorithm based on a new semantic similarity measure for partitioning given ontology into high quality modules. The results show that our approach produces meaningful clusters than the traditional algorithm of K-means.",

		"abstract": "Object-based image classification consists in the assignment of object that share similar attributes to object categories. To perform such a task the remote sensing expert uses its personal knowledge, which is rarely formalized. Ontologies have been proposed as solution to represent domain knowledge agreed by domain experts in a formal and machine readable language. Classical ontology languages are not appropriate to deal with imprecision or vagueness in knowledge. Fortunately, Description Logics for the semantic web has been enhanced by various approaches to handle such knowledge. This paper presents the extension of the traditional ontology-based interpretation with fuzzy ontology of main land-cover classes in Landsat8-OLI scenes (vegetation, built-up areas, water bodies, shadow, clouds, forests) objects. A good classification of image objects was obtained and the results highlight the potential of the method to be replicated over time and space in the perspective of transferability of the procedure.",

When concepts supported by an information system are getting outdated or misaligned, concept location becomes a time-consuming and error-prone task. Moreover, information systems embed significant business knowledge over time that is neither present nor documented anywhere else. For this reason, this paper proposes an approach to locate concepts in execution traces, which contain the actual and current information derived from the execution of the existing code. This approach, based on text segmentation tools, first retrieves and depicts relevant information from the execution traces, and then, it provides a mapping between such information and particular pieces of source code. The main idea of the approach is to take the file of the trace as text where the content of each function (i.e., method) appearing in the trace is a sentence composing the text and then applying the C99 algorithm to segment the text to a thematically coherent segments. The C99 is the state of the art algorithm proposed in text mining community to segment natural text. Each produced segment is composed by a set of functions or methods and bears a concept. Also, under this idea all techniques, proposed by text mining community, for text segmentation will be accessible to the software evolution community. We evaluated our approach on different execution scenarios of JHotDraw and ArgoUML.",

		"abstract": "With the advent of new forms of information and communication technologies, the consumer needs to combine and customize different travel components as a complete travel package, namely: Dynamic Packaging Technology. Nevertheless, disparate tourist offers and services make it difficult for consumer to use them effectively. Therefore, our paper presents an intelligent querying framework of OWL-S travel services, called SQUIREL composition engine. It uses Semantic Web Services (SWSs) technologies combined with the useful of Linked e-tourism Data concept to fulfill the preferences and constraints of the e-tourist any time. This purpose supports SWSs pre-selection through the valuation of the rewritten SPARQL consumer query at runtime that manages dynamic service dependencies extracted from Linked e-tourism Data and returns the SWSs endpoint. Then, SQUIREL catches this endpoint and makes the necessary optimizations to refine it to its relevant atomic processes needed to be composed using matrix computation. However, the experimental results indicate that this method owns both lower computation cost and higher success ratio of fine-grained discoverybased atomic processes composition.",

Most of the Web applications represent the data under a structured format, in particularly tables and lists. These data are automatically generated from databases, so they have a restricted access. RDF (Resource Description Framework) offers an effective mechanism, which allows structuring the data on the Web in a simple format, so it makes them directly accessible. In this paper we propose a framework that allows to transform the hidden data on the Web into Linked Data. The framework contains four layers according to MDA (Model Driven Architecture): (1) the layer M0 allows to build a source model from a Web application, (2) layer M1 contains the source model and mapping rules, (3) layer M2 enables to define meta-models of the models included in the layer M1, at the last, (4) layer M3 describes the meta-models using a language of meta-meta-model, such as MOF or ECORE of the framework EMF. At the end of this transformation process, we obtain a target RDF model, which represents data of the Web application.",

The approach is composed of three steps.

Two modules are reported as clones if the DTW similarity value between them is greater than some predefined threshold.

		"abstract": "Currently, a good portion of datasets on Internet are accessed through data services, where user’s queries are answered as a composition of multiple data services. Defining the semantics of data services is the first step towards automating their composition. An interesting approach to define the semantics of data services is by describing them as semantic views over a domain ontology. However, defining such semantic views cannot always be done with certainty, especially when the service’s returned data are too complex. In such case, a data service is associated with several possible semantic views. In addition, complex correlations may be present among these possible semantic views, mainly when data services encapsulate the same data sources. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach to model the semantic uncertainty of data services. Services along with their possible semantic views are represented in probabilistic service registry. The correlations among service semantics are modeled through a directed probabilistic graphical model (Bayesian network). Based on our modeling, we study the problem of compositing correlated data services to answer a user query, and propose an efficient method to compute the different possible compositions and their probabilities.",

With the ever increasing amount of data sets available in the LOD Cloud, it is already beyond the human capability to integrate heterogeneous data manually. So far, the task of Linked Data fusion entails a significant amount of time owing to the large number of instances in the data sets from the LOD Cloud. In this paper, we suggest a new system to efficiently combine heterogeneous data from the LOD Cloud. First, we extract similar instances from the LOD Cloud to identify identical or related information. Then, our system collects all predicates and objects of the similar instances to construct a set of trees. Finally, we propose a genetic algorithm to merge data in the constructed trees. In the following, we give an overview of our system architecture and we detail our genetic algorithm. We also evaluate our system using real data sets showing that it can increase the completeness and the conciseness in data fusion. Moreover, we prove that our system is faster when fusing large data sets from the LOD Cloud.",

Therefore, it enhances semantic interoperability for many web based applications. However, ontology change following applications new requirements or new perception of domain knowledges can leads to undesirable knowledge such as inconsistent and therefore to a useless alignment. Ontologies and alignments are encoded in knowledge bases allowing applications to store only some explicit knowledge while they derive implicit ones by applying reasoning services on these knowledge bases. This underlying representation of ontologies and alignments leads us to follow base revision theory to deal with alignment revision under ontology change. For that purpose, we adapt kernel contraction framework to design rational operators and to formulate the set of postulates that characterize each class of these operators. We demonstrate the connection between each class of operators and the set of postulates that characterize them. Finally, we present algorithms to compute alignment kernels and incision functions. Kernels are sets of correspondences responsible of undesirable knowledge following alignment semantics. Incision functions determine the sets of correspondences to eliminate in order to restore alignment consistency or to realize a successful contraction.",

		"source": "Semantic Scholar",
		"abstract": "The fast development and the huge number of existing web services have raised the problem of the urgent need for matchmaking mechanisms. However state-of-the-art matchmakers are unsuitable for locating web services that use different ontologies. This aspect is important since it is not realistic to assume that Web services will always be defined by the same ontology, as the Web service requester and provider operate independently, each defines their own ontologies to describe their services. This is an emergent research issue that has not been well addressed. This work is a contribution to achieve semantic interoperability in a multi-ontology environment. This paper describes a Web service multi-ontology matchmaker for SAWSDL services, called SAWSDL-MOM which locates web services that use different ontologies. The matchmaker engine incorporates a novel partial ontology alignment algorithm with syntax, linguistic and original structural matchers. In determining the 1:1 mappings the Hungarian algorithm is used. Finally a matchmaking strategy is utilized in finding the score of each service. Experimental evaluation and comparison provide strong evidence that SAWSDL-MOM can significantly improve results, achieve better interoperability and scalability.",

The QAS provides a correct response to the question asked by a user in natural language. QAS uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to interface with the system user. In this paper we survey various QAS such as Natural Language Interface to DataBases (NLIDB), Ontology based question answering and Question answering systems for unstructured data. We give also statistics and analysis. This can help researchers to choose an appropriate solution to their issues. In case of insufficiency, they can propose new systems for complex queries and adapt or reuse QAS techniques for specific research issues. We give also our point of view on how can QAS deal with Arabic Linked Data.",

With the proliferation of domain ontologies and the large volume of data to be processed, it has become necessary to have data management systems based on ontological systems. Such a system can be exploited via the web as is the case with XML databases, which will allow us to: - use semantic databases via the Internet. - To enrich responses to XML queries by using domain terminology ontology. Also, XML present a flexible hierarchical model suitable to represent huge amounts of data with no absolute and fixed schema, In order to highlight the usefulness of introducing the semantics in the XML database and to enrich the answers to the queries, we have proposed a semi-automatic solution that we applied it for pharmaceutical databases, and which gave very encouraging preliminary results.",

A good requirements model quality may lead to a good DW quality [2]. Various authors have proposed metrics to assure the quality of conceptual, logical and physical models for DW. However, there is no significant work in the DW literature to assure the requirements model quality. Starting from a misinterpretation of fuzzy requirements, all data warehouse conceptions and OLAP analysis ensuing will be wrong. To design a DW model, it is necessary to take into account not only data sources, but also the analysis requirements. Therefore, in the literature they have focused studies on the data inaccuracy but not in queries-based requirements imprecision. In order to evaluate the queries-based requirements imprecision and in order to improve the data warehouse design quality and inspiring Fasel model, this paper presents a naive solution which represent a structural proposition for the update data warehouse case.

Therefore, there is a need to predefine links between these resources to permit an easy combination. In this paper, we propose a new approach to make Restful Web APIs adhere to Linked Data principles, which facilitate their combination in mashup applications. The advantage of the proposed approach is the fact that it allows integrating linked data with the composition of Restful APIs, It also uses an algorithm to automatically create links between APIs.",

These systems allow users to ask a question in Arabic natural language and get the relevant answer. However, most existing QA systems focused on English and Latin-based languages. Less effort has been concentrated on the Arabic language, which belongs to \"Semitic Languages\". This work is an early version of a new domain-independent Arabic question answering system over linked data, which aims to particularly help Arab users to explore the Arabic Semantic Web based on Arabic ontology. We describe with sufficient details the different modules of our proposed system, which uses language parser, finite state automaton and semantic Web techniques to linguistically process and answer Arabic natural language question. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate and show efficiency of the proposed system.",

		"abstract": "The Web has become a tremendously huge data source hidden under linked documents. A significant number of Web documents include HTML tables generated dynamically from relational databases. Often, there is no direct public access to the databases themselves. On the other hand, RDF (Resource Description Framework) gives an efficient mechanism to represent directly data on the Web based on a Web-scalable architecture for identification and interpretation of terms. This leads to the concept of Linked Data on the Web. To allow direct access to data on the Web as Linked Data, we propose in this paper an approach to transform HTML tables into RDF triples. It consists of three main phases: refining, pre-treatment and mapping. The whole process is assisted by a domain ontology and the WordNet lexical database. A tool called Htab2RDF has been implemented. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate and show efficiency of the proposed approach.",

In order to evaluate the imprecision expression in decisional requirements and differently to our previous paper, we present an ontological solution using our GLMR ontology model for fuzzy connector evaluation in a query-based requirement. For simplification reasons, we present in this paper only “and if possible” fuzzy connector case. We will propose a new solution combining two recent existent solutions. Although the fuzzy connector assessment was already treated but, according to our knowledge, never in the decision need context and proposing an ontological solution. The preliminary tests of our ontological solution are encouraging.",

One of the important performances optimization techniques in XML data warehouse is fragmentation with its different variants (horizontal fragmentation and vertical fragmentation). In this paper, we develop a hybrid fragmentation algorithm combining a vertical fragmentation based on XPath expressions and a horizontal fragmentation based on selection predicates. To control the number of fragments, we use the K-Means algorithm. Finally, we validate our approach under Oracle Berkeley DB XML by several experiments done on XML data, derived from the XWB benchmark.",

		"abstract": "The horizontal fragmentation of the data warehouse is considered as one of the important performance optimisation techniques of the decision-support queries. This optimisation is reached only if the large data volume of the fact table is horizontally fragmented. For that, the fragments of the fact table are always derived from the fragments of the dimension tables. Unfortunately, in this type of fragmentation, the fragments number can dramatically increase, and their maintenance becomes quite hard and costly. Thus, to reduce the number of the fragments and to further optimise the decision-support queries performances, we propose to fragment horizontally only the fact table by exploiting jointly: the selectivities of the selection predicates, their occurrence numbers, and their access frequencies. To prove the effectiveness of our fragmentation technique, we present at the end, a set of experimental results conducted under Oracle 10g on the APB-1 benchmark.",

Clustering this type of data requires both time and memory restrictions. In this paper, we propose S2G-Stream based on growing neural gas and soft subspace clustering. We introduce two types of entropy weighting for both features and subspaces.

		"abstract": "The urbanization of Algeria and the new consumer habits of its cities' inhabitants generate large quantities of waste. Despite the many programs put in place, this waste potential is often managed unproductively. In the absence of an effective strategy and the necessary budget, waste treatment in most Algerian municipalities ignores environmental problems and leads to public health problems. This article therefore proposes a decision-making tool for the treatment of urban waste taking into account environmental criteria. The adopted approach consists in classifying five candidate management programs: the current program (1), selective sorting by the population (2), selective sorting by dedicated operators (3), the current program, improved by a deposit system for plastic bottles (4), and incineration and sorting of heavy metals (5). Four environmental criteria were identified: the first, an increased percentage of waste recovery, and the other three, decreases in visual pollution, toxic pollution and noise pollution. The classification approach, based on a multicriteria analysis, was applied to a city in western Algeria. After a sensitivity study, the final classification identified the second plan, (selective sorting at the source) as the dominant plan. Plans 3 and 5 both ranked second. The current management programs, 4 and 1, were in last place, and thus proved inadequate with regard to environmental criteria. They should be abandoned in favor of a strategy involving the population, with increased awareness of health impacts.",

		"abstract": "A reverse supply chain is viewed as a process from consumption point to recovery point and the management of domestic waste is considered as a specific and complex reverse supply chain. This important sector represents a high challenging problem for our cities,constrained by financial,social,health and environmental considerations. This paper proposes multicriteria decision aid to help choose an efficient domestic waste management strategy. In fact,Multicriteria decision making techniques are considered as a key option to solve this type of problems,giving a solution that represents a good compromise between different preferences. The adopted approach consists in outranking a set of candidate management plans using a method based on partial aggregation criteria. This model is applied on a real case study of an Algerian city and to validate the obtained results,a deep sensitivity analysis is carried out,giving the most appropriate plans.",

		"source": "ResearchGate",
		"abstract": "Predictive, proactive and reliability-based maintenance are considered among the most widely used approaches in the field of maintenance optimization of wind turbines. Nevertheless, most existing models are designed to optimize the maintenance of a single component of a wind turbine and do not take into consideration the different dependencies that exist between components, which does not guarantee the performance of the system.\nThis paper proposes a detailed classification of the various components of a wind turbine according to their causes of failure based on the stochastic dependencies, which characterize the process of degradation of the system. The purpose of this classification is to allow maintenance operators and manufacturers both to have efficient systems in terms of performance, reliability and cost.",

		"abstract": "Subspace clustering has been successfully applied in many domains and its goal is to simultaneously detect both clusters and subspaces of the original feature space where these clusters exist. A Data stream is a massive sequences of data coming continuously. Clustering this type of data requires some restrictions in time and memory. In this paper we propose a new method named S2G-Stream based on clustering data streams and soft subspace clustering. Experiments on public datasets showed the ability of S2G-Stream to detect simultaneously the best features, subspaces and the best clustering.",

		"abstract": "Nowadays, the web is becoming highly used technology, in our community. This technology allows us to work in collaboration and to share knowledge. The pragmatic web represents the most recent extension of the web (semantic web); which facilitates the exploitation and the interpretation of the data by the machine. This web is based on three important components, the context, the community, and the meaning negotiation. The Meaning negotiation is the most important component of the pragmatic web on which we will fix our attention. It plays an important role in the exchanges and resolves conflicts in people cooperation activities. The knowledge (context) of each part in the community of users is heterogeneous; this will make the meaning negotiation complicated. This paper realizes a meaning negotiation scenario based on the ontologies merging into the geopolitical domain. This will reduce and simplifies the process, and improves the semantics of data.",

		"abstract": "The Web of Things (WoT), facilitates the interconnection of different types of real-world objects, integrating them into the virtual world and ensuring their interoperability through Web services. However, it remains a challenge to automate the tasks connected objects need to deal with. In this paper, we focus on the development of smart web services that automate service tasks, autonomously adapt to context changes in the object’s environment, and to users’ preferences. In this article, we propose a software framework for smart services that relies on a reactive and proactive approach to deal with context and its temporal aspects. Smart web services developed according to these principles can react to current situations and proactively anticipate an unforeseen situation in order to take the right decision.",
