		"source": "Zotero",
		"abstract": "In this article, we analyze the existence of solutions for a nonclassical reaction-diﬀusion equation with critical nonlinearity, a time-dependent force with exponential growth and delayed force term, where the delay term can be entrained by a function under assumptions of measurability. Using a priori estimates we obtain the pullback D-absorbing process and the pullback ω-D-limit compactness that allow us to prove the existence of the pullback D-attractors for the associated process to the problem.",
