		"abstract": "In order to overcome the energy loss involved by communications in wireless sensor networks (WSN), the use of clustering has proven to be effective. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic centralized genetic algorithm (GA)-based clustering approach to optimize the clustering configuration (cluster heads and cluster members) to limit node energy consumption. The obtained simulation results show that the proposed technique overcomes the LEACH clustering algorithm.",

This lifetime depends strongly on how efficiently such energy is distributed over the nodes especially during transmitting and receiving data. Each node may route messages to destination nodes either through short hops or long hops. Optimizing the length of these hops may save energy, and therefore extend the lifetime of WSNs. In this paper, we propose a theorem to optimize the hop’s length so to make WSN power consumption minimal. The theorem establishes a simple condition on hop’s length range.
